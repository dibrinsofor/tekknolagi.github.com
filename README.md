# My blog

Hello there. This is the source for my blog. It is a small website built with
Jekyll. You are welcome to re-use the CSS; it is MIT licensed. All I ask is
that you remove all references to me from it, including:

* My name
* My social links
* My writing (all posts and pages)
* My Google Analytics tag
* My GoatCounter tag

Thanks.

## It's big though

But honestly, you probably should not fork it. You should copy it wholesale
into a new Git repository because the history contains some large assets.
